\subsection{Logan - Have a Backup Plan}
We started off the semester with a great group of individuals who are all capable and motivated. We were able to assign appropriate roles based on each member's skillset and what they wanted to do. Even with that, you have to count on things going wrong. I didn’t plan on getting very sick for over a month or having to miss a week and a half of school. The biggest problem was that it made it hard to communicate with the team and help coordinate who was taking over my responsibilities temporarily. Nathan really stepped up and helped keep the group on track with our schedule. I could have also been better about following up when people couldn’t make meetings due to other commitments. Occasionally, it would be the next weekly meeting before I got caught up on their progress.

\subsection{Andrew - Pair Programming}
Pair programming is fun and helpful. When we worked in pairs on one computer we wrote better code, faster. Having two sets of eyes looking out for syntax errors and keeping logic consistent went a very long way in helping to reduce bugs and accomplish tasks in a more timely fashion. I felt this was helpful especially in the beginning when we were all learning ocaml because I would remember some syntax and functions and my partner would remember others. In this respect, we were able to learn from each other. The knowledge transfer experience contributed to the cohesion of our group.

\subsection{Nathan - Projects Will Take as Much Time as You Let Them}
I learned that no matter how ambitious or puny a project may seem at
first, the expectations and goals attached to that project can and
will grow and shrink as availability becomes more or less scarce: in
other words, projects will grow to fill the time allotted to them. We
originally envisioned the project being functionally done a week
before it was due, but since we had that buffer time, why not use it?
And now here we are, pushing this up to the last minute. This lesson
can also be known as ``self discipline is hard''.

Example timeline for completion of steps
Having deadlines for individual parts of the compiler
I feel it might even be beneficial for the class to implement advised deadlines for groups that would recommend implementing this aspect of the compiler by this date.
