\subsection{Logan - Have a Backup Plan}
We started off the semester with a great group of individuals who are all capable and motivated. We were able to assign appropriate roles based on each member's skillset and what they wanted to do. Even with that, you have to count on things going wrong. I didn’t plan on getting very sick for over a month or having to miss a week and a half of school. The biggest problem was that it made it hard to communicate with the team and help coordinate who was taking over my responsibilities temporarily. Nathan really stepped up and helped keep the group on track with our schedule. I could have also been better about following up when people couldn’t make meetings due to other commitments. Occasionally, it would be the next weekly meeting before I got caught up on their progress.

\subsection{Andrew - Pair Programming}
Pair programming is fun and helpful. When we worked in pairs on one computer we wrote better code, faster. Having two sets of eyes looking out for syntax errors and keeping logic consistent went a very long way in helping to reduce bugs and accomplish tasks in a more timely fashion. I felt this was helpful especially in the beginning when we were all learning ocaml because I would remember some syntax and functions and my partner would remember others. In this respect, we were able to learn from each other. The knowledge transfer experience contributed to the cohesion of our group.
