So when you are writing your parts here are the things to know.

1) If you need a header use

\section{name}
\subsection{name}
\subsubsection{name}

to organize your work, latex will automatically number all of the parts consecutively. The part headers are built into the main documents so don't worry about those.

2) You do not need a header or document tags, just write the text for your section in your document. You can just type text normally and it will put it in paragraph form.

3) You will need to check all ' and "" to make sure they print correctly. to make double quotes, the first is two backticks `` and the second is to apostrophes '' so ``hello'' will produce "hello". ' may need to be retyped if they don't show up.

4) If you want to make lists
for bullet points:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lessons learned individually
\end{itemize}

for numbered:
\begin{enumerate}
\itemAdd more assignment operators: *=, \textbackslash=, +=, -=, \%=
\end{enumerate}

5) If you want to insert lines of code
\begin{verbatim}
int fib(n) {
       if (n == 0)
         return 0;
\end{verbatim}
for inline code use \verb=code= or \verb$code$

6) Special characters
# $ % & \ ^ _ { } ~
can be written as
\# \$ \% \& \_ \{ \}

7) Formatting
\\ creates a new line after previous text
\newline also works
if it looks weird you can use
\textit{text} makes text italic
