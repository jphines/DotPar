scripts/tutorial/run.sh texname.tex

Note: this checks syntax between \begin{verbatim} and \end{verbatim} markers.
This includes some stuff that isn't code, such as instructions on compilation.
For the short-term, I just hardcode these strings as strings we don't need to
check for syntax in the ruby script. A better long-term solution would be to
have some sort of tag associated with either the code or the non-code.

You should be in the DotPar/scripts/tutorial directory when you run this.
